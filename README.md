# An Inventory System

This is an inventory system for Unity3D games. It uses the new UI system and the goal is to make it easy to customize and integrate as possible.

###### Current features
- Creating inventory from a script using predefined prefabs.
- Moving items around. Very similar to how inventory works in Minecraft (except there is no hold and drag yet).
- Define items (using ScriptableObjects), assign any specific properties and such. Items can also have specific properties set separate from what is predefined (a full int is dedicated to be altered using bit manipulation).
- Information when hovering on an item.

###### Planned features
- Multiple inventories.
- Interaction between 2 or more inventories (for example useful when trading items).
- UNet integration.
- Saving inventory state.
